  "summary": "The diff implements messaging and photo posting features with backend data models and functions, frontend UI components for messages/chat and photo feed/posting, and navigation integration. Most requirements are implemented, though some acceptance criteria details are missing or partially implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Users can only send messages to profiles they have mutually matched with",
      "reason": "The backend sendMessage function checks areUsersMatched() which only verifies mutual likes, but the frontend MessagesPage comment says 'For now, we'll show all liked profiles as potential conversations. In a real app, you'd need to check if they also liked back' - indicating incomplete mutual match verification in the conversation list",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Conversation list shows last message preview",
      "reason": "MessagesPage shows lastMessage.content but does not appear to handle cases where messages might be from different conversations properly - the logic sorts all sent and received messages together without filtering by conversation partner first",
